## 🔍 Understanding Output Format

### Test Cases Show Exactly What Your Program Should Output

**Example: Print Numbers 1 to 3**
```
Output: 1
2
3

(Each number on a new line)
```

Your program should print exactly this - nothing more, nothing less.

**Example: Print with Specific Format**
```
Output: x=10, y=20
```

Your program should print exactly: `x=10, y=20`

---

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### If Your Code Doesn't Work:

1. **Check the Output Format**
   - Are you printing exactly what's shown?
   - Did you include all spaces/newlines?

2. **Use Test Cases**
   - Your code should match all test cases
   - Run against each example

3. **Review Common Mistakes**
   - What errors do beginners make?
   - Are you making one of them?

4. **Read the Hint**
   - Small nudge in the right direction
   - Usually one sentence

5. **Look at Related Lesson**
   - Refresh your memory on the concept
   - Review code examples
