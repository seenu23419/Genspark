It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and released in **1991**.\n\n### What is Python?\nPython is a **high-level, interpreted** programming language. This means:\n- **High-level**: The code looks like English, making it easy for humans to read and write.\n- **Interpreted**: You don't need to compile it before running. The computer reads the code line-by-line and executes it immediately.\n\n### Where is Python Used? (Real-Life Examples)\nPython is everywhere! Here are some places where it powers the technology you use daily:\n- **YouTube & Netflix**: Used for recommending videos you might like.\n- **Instagram**: The backend (server-side) of Instagram is built largely on Python.\n- **NASA**: Used for complex scientific calculations and space mission planning.\n- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Python is the #1 language for building AI like ChatGPT.\n- **Automation**: Writing small scripts to handle repetitive tasks (like renaming 1000 files in a second).\n\n### Why Python is Beginner-Friendly?\n1. **Readable Syntax**: It uses simple English words. To print something, you just type `print()`.\n2. **No Braces**: Unlike C++ or Java, Python uses **indentation** (spacing) to organize code, making it look much cleaner.\n3. **Less Code**: You can do in 2 lines of Python what might take 10 lines in other languages.\n\n> **💡 Pro Tip:** Python is named after the 'Monty Python' comedy group, not the snake!\n\n---\n\n### What to Remember\n- Python is a high-level, interpreted language.\n- It is famous for its readability and simple syntax.\n- It is used in AI, Web Development, and Automation.",

                "content": "# 🛠️ Installing Python & Your First Program\n\nBefore writing code, we need the **Python Interpreter**. Think of the interpreter as a translator that converts your English-like Python code into instructions the computer understands.\n\n### How Python Runs Code\nWhen you run a Python file (usually ending in `.py`), two things happen:\n1. The **Interpreter** checks your code for mistakes (syntax errors).\n2. If okay, it executes the code **from top to bottom**.\n\n### The print() Function\nThe `print()` function is used to display information on the screen. It is the most used function for beginners to see their results.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\nprint(\"Hello GenSpark!\")\nprint(100)\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works (Line-by-Line)\n- `print(\"Hello GenSpark!\")`: Python looks at the `print` command, sees the text inside the quotes `\" \"`, and sends it to your screen.\n- `print(100)`: Python sees the number `100` and displays it. Note that numbers don't strictly need quotes.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Case Sensitivity**: Typing `Print()` instead of `print()`. Python is case-sensitive; `P` and `p` are different!\n- **Missing Quotes**: Forgetting quotes around text, like `print(Hello)`. Python will think `Hello` is a variable and throw an error.\n- **Missing Parentheses**: Writing `print \"Hello\"` (this worked in older Python 2, but fails in Python 3).\n\n### What to Remember\n- Python files end with the `.py` extension.\n- Use `print()` to see output.\n- Always use lowercase for `print` and don't forget the parentheses `()`.\n\n> **💡 Pro Tip:** You can use single quotes `' '` or double quotes `\" \"` for text. Both work exactly the same in Python!",

                "content": "# 📦 Variables & Data Types\n\nA **Variable** is a named location in memory used to store data. Think of it as a container with a label; you put something inside, and the label tells you how to find it.\n\n---\n\n## Syntax for Creating Variables\n\n```python\nvariable_name = value\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```python\nname = \"Alice\" # Label: name, Value: \"Alice\"\nage = 25       # Label: age, Value: 25\n```\n\n---\n\n## Rules for Naming Variables\n\nIdentifiers (names) in Python must follow these strict rules:\n1.  **Characters**: Use letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).\n2.  **No Leading Digits**: Names cannot start with a number (e.g., `1score` is invalid).\n3.  **Case Sensitivity**: `Value` and `value` are two different variables.\n4.  **No Spaces**: Use underscores for multiple words (e.g., `user_score`).\n5.  **Keywords**: Do not use reserved words like `if`, `while`, or `class`.\n\n---\n\n## Data Type Categories\n\nPython organizes data into two main categories: **Primitive (Standard)** and **Non-Primitive (Collections)**.\n\n### 1. Primitive Data Types (Standard)\nThese are the most basic types that store a single value.\n- **Integer (int)**: Whole numbers like `10`, `-5`.\n- **Float**: Decimal numbers like `3.14`.\n- **String (str)**: Text like `\"Hello\"`.\n- **Boolean (bool)**: Logic values `True` or `False`.\n\n### 2. Non-Primitive Data Types (Collections)\nThese types store multiple values in a single variable. You will learn these in detail in Level 3!\n- **List**: Group of items, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.\n- **Tuple**: Fixed group of items, e.g., `(10, 20)`.\n- **Dictionary**: Key-value pairs, e.g., `{\"name\": \"John\"}`.\n- **Set**: Unique items, e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`.\n\n---\n\n## Type Casting (Conversion)\n\nSometimes you need to change one type into another. We use built-in functions for this:\n- `int()`: Converts to an integer.\n- `float()`: Converts to a decimal.\n- `str()`: Converts to text.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\nx = \"10\"      # This is a string\ny = int(x)    # Now it's a number 10\nprint(y + 5)  # Output: 15\n```\n\n---\n\n## Constants (By Convention)\n\nIn Python, there is no strict \"Constant\" keyword. Instead, we write names in **ALL_CAPS** to tell other programmers: \"Please do not change this value!\"\n\n**Example:**\n```python\nPI = 3.14159\nMAX_USERS = 500\n```\n\n---\n\n## Complete Example Program\n\n```python\n# Variable Declaration\nuser_name = \"John Doe\"    # String (Primitive)\nuser_age = 21             # Integer (Primitive)\nis_enrolled = True        # Boolean (Primitive)\n\n# A Non-Primitive Example (List)\nfav_colors = [\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\"]\n\n# Displaying the data\nprint(\"--- User Profile ---\")\nprint(\"Name:\", user_name)\nprint(\"Age:\", user_age)\nprint(\"Colors:\", fav_colors)\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works?\n1. `user_name = \"John Doe\"`: Creates a string variable.\n2. `fav_colors = [...]`: Creates a **Non-Primitive** list storing three strings.\n3. `print(\"Name:\", user_name)`: Combines text with the variable value on one line.\n\n### 💻 Expected Output\n```text\n--- User Profile ---\nName: John Doe\nAge: 21\nColors: ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue']\n```",

                "content": "# 🔑 Keywords & Identifiers\n\nIn Python, we use names to identify variables, functions, and classes. However, some words are reserved for Python's own use. This lesson explains how to name your data correctly and which words to avoid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Keywords (Reserved Words)\n\nKeywords are words that have a fixed meaning in Python. You **cannot** use them as names for your variables or functions.\n\n### Categorized Keywords\n- **Logic & Values**: `True`, `False`, `None`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `is`.\n- **Control Flow**: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `return`.\n- **Structural**: `def` (for functions), `class` (for objects), `import`, `from`, `as`, `pass`.\n\n### Hard vs. Soft Keywords\nGenerally, keywords are \"hard\" (strictly reserved). However, newer versions of Python introduced **Soft Keywords** like `match` and `case`. These have special meaning in some places but can still be used as variable names elsewhere (though it's best to avoid them!).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identifiers (Naming Rules)\n\nAn **Identifier** is a name you create for a variable, function, or class. You must follow these rules:\n\n1.  **Allowed Characters**: Letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (`_`).\n2.  **No Leading Digits**: A name cannot start with a number (e.g., `1variable` is WRONG).\n3.  **No Special Symbols**: You cannot use `@`, `$`, `#`, `!`, or spaces.\n4.  **Case Sensitive**: `Age` and `age` are two different containers.\n\n---\n\n## 3. PEP 8 Naming Conventions\n\n**PEP 8** is the official style guide for Python. Writing \"Pythonic\" code means following these naming patterns:\n\n- **Variables & Functions**: Use `snake_case` (lowercase with underscores).\n  - ✅ `user_name`, `calculate_total()`\n- **Constants**: Use `ALL_CAPS`.\n  - ✅ `MAX_USERS`, `PI`\n- **Classes**: Use `PascalCase` (capitalize every word).\n  - ✅ `UserProfile`, `SmartCar`\n\n---\n\n## Best Practice: Descriptive Naming\n\nAlways choose names that describe what the data holds. This makes your code \"self-documenting.\"\n- ❌ **Bad**: `x = 50` (What is x?)\n- ✅ **Good**: `car_speed = 50` (Much clearer!)\n\n---\n\n## Example: Putting it All Together\n\n```python\n# Keywords used: import, def, if, return\n# Identifiers created: math, circle_area, radius, PI_VALUE\n\nimport math\n\nPI_VALUE = 3.14  # Constant (PEP 8)\n\ndef circle_area(radius):\n    area = PI_VALUE * (radius * radius)\n    return area\n\n# Using the function\nresult = circle_area(5)\nprint(\"Total Area:\", result)\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works?\n1. `import math`: Uses the `import` keyword to bring in library tools.\n2. `circle_area`: An identifier (name) for our function.\n3. `radius`: An identifier for the data we pass into the function.\n4. `return`: A keyword that sends the result back.\n\n### 💻 Expected Output\n```text\nTotal Area: 78.5\n```\n\n### What to Remember\n- Keywords are reserved for the language.\n- Identifiers must follow naming rules.\n- Follow PEP 8 (`snake_case`) to write professional code.",

This lesson covers how to receive data from a user and how to present results professionally.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Taking Input with input()\n\nThe `input()` function pauses your program and waits for the user to type something. You can provide a \"prompt\" message between the brackets.\n\n```python\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n```\n\n### ⚠️ The \"String\" Trap\nBy default, `input()` always treats everything as **Text (str)**. If a user types `10`, Python sees it as `\"10\"`. You cannot do math with it unless you convert it.\n\n**Example (The Error):**\n```python\nage = input(\"Enter age: \")\n# User types 20\nprint(age + 1) # ERROR: Cannot add string to number\n```\n\n**The Solution (Type Casting):**\n```python\n# Wrap input() inside int() or float()\nage = int(input(\"Enter age: \"))\nprint(age + 1) # Result: 21\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Displaying Output with print()\n\nPython's `print()` is versatile. You can print multiple items by separating them with commas.\n\n```python\nprint(\"User:\", \"John\", \"Age:\", 25)\n# Output: User: John Age: 25\n```\n\n### Formatted Strings (f-strings)\nThe modern way to print variables inside text is using **f-strings**. Just put an `f` before the quotes and use `{}` for variables.\n\n```python\nprice = 99.9\nprint(f\"The cost is ${price}\")\n# Output: The cost is $99.9\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Complete Example: Bill Calculator\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Get Inputs\ntotal_bill = float(input(\"Enter total bill: \"))\npeople = int(input(\"Number of people: \"))\n\n# Step 2: Calculation\neach_pays = total_bill / people\n\n# Step 3: Output using f-string\nprint(f\"Each person should pay: ${each_pays}\")\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works?\n1. `float(input(...))`: Converts the user's bill (e.g., \"100.50\") into a decimal number.\n2. `int(input(...))`: Converts the number of people into a whole number.\n3. `f\"...{each_pays}\"`: Dynamically inserts the calculated value into the final message.\n\n### 💻 Expected Output\n```text\nEnter total bill: 100\nNumber of people: 4\nEach person should pay: $25.0\n```\n\n### What to Remember\n- `input()` returns a string by default.\n- Use `int()` or `float()` to convert input for math.\n- Use **f-strings** (`f\"...{var}\"`) for clean, professional output.",

In Python, operators allow you to calculate numbers, compare values, and control logic.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Arithmetic Operators\n\nThese are used for basic mathematical operations.\n\n- `+` (Addition): `10 + 5 = 15`\n- `-` (Subtraction): `10 - 5 = 5`\n- `*` (Multiplication): `10 * 5 = 50`\n- `/` (Division): `10 / 4 = 2.5`\n- `//` (Floor Division): Rounds down. `10 // 4 = 2`\n- `%` (Modulo): Remainder. `10 % 3 = 1`\n- `**` (Exponentiation): `2 ** 3 = 8`\n\n---\n\n## 2. Comparison (Relational) Operators\n\nCompare two values and return `True` or `False`.\n- `==` (Equal), `!=` (Not Equal), `>` (Greater), `<` (Less), `>=` (Greater/Equal), `<=` (Less/Equal).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Logical Operators\n\nCombine conditions.\n- `and`: Both must be true.\n- `or`: At least one must be true.\n- `not`: Reverses the result.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Assignment Operators\n\nUsed to store values. Supports Compound Assignment:\n- `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `//=`, `**=`.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Note: Increment & Decrement\n\nUnlike C or Java, Python **does NOT** have the `++` or `--` operators.\n\n- ❌ `count++` (WRONG)\n- ✅ `count += 1` (CORRECT)\n\nTo increase or decrease a value, you must use the `+=` or `-=` assignment operators.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Bitwise Operators\n\nThese work on the **binary (0 and 1)** representation of numbers.\n- `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `^` (XOR), `~` (NOT), `<<` (Left Shift), `>>` (Right Shift).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Specialty Operators (Python Specific)\n\n### Membership Operators\n- `in`: `True` if value is in a list/string.\n- `not in`: `True` if value is absent.\n\n### Identity Operators\n- `is`: `True` if they are the same object in memory.\n- `is not`: `True` if they are different.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Ternary Operator (Conditional Expression)\n\n**Syntax:** `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`\n\n**Example:**\n```python\nstatus = \"Adult\" if age >= 18 else \"Minor\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Complete Operator Example\n\n```python\n# Arithmetic & Assignment\ncount = 10\ncount += 1  # Increment (Replaces ++)\n\n# Bitwise & Ternary\nx = 5  # 0101\nand_res = x & 3 # 1\n\n# Membership\nmsg = \"Hello\"\nis_found = \"e\" in msg\n\n# Output\nprint(f\"Final Count: {count}\")\nprint(f\"is 'e' found? {is_found}\")\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works?\n1. `count += 1`: Python doesn't support `++`, so we use this shorthand to increase the variable by 1.\n2. `\"e\" in msg`: Checks if the character 'e' exists within the string \"Hello\".\n\n### 💻 Expected Output\n```text\nFinal Count: 11\nis 'e' found? True\n```\n\n---\n\n## Operator Precedence (Order of Math)\n1. `()` | 2. `**` | 3. `* / // %` | 4. `+ -` | 5. `<< >>` | 6. `& ^ |` | 7. `> < == !=` | 8. `is in` | 9. `not and or`",

                "content": "# 🎓 Lesson 7: Selection Control Structures (if, elif, else)\n\nIn computer science, **Selection Control Structures** are used to control the flow of execution based on logical conditions. These structures allow a program to choose different paths of execution, making the software dynamic and intelligent.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Unary Selection (The `if` Statement)\n\nUnary selection is a single-path control structure. The code block is executed **only** if the condition evaluates to `True`. If the condition is `False`, the block is simply ignored.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nif condition:\n    # code to run if condition is True\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nscore = 85\n\nif score >= 50:\n    print(\"Assessment: Evaluation Passed.\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nAssessment: Evaluation Passed.\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1. The interpreter evaluates the relational expression `score >= 50`.\n2. Since `85` is greater than or equal to `50`, the result is `True`.\n3. The indented `print` statement is executed. If the score were `30`, nothing would be displayed.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Binary Selection (The `if-else` Statement)\n\nBinary selection provides two mutually exclusive paths. It ensures that the algorithm performs one action if the condition is met, and a **different** action if it is not.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nif condition:\n    # path executed if True\nelse:\n    # path executed if False\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nage = 16\n\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"Status: Eligible to vote.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Status: Requirement not met.\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nStatus: Requirement not met.\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1. The condition `age >= 18` is checked.\n2. In this case, `16 >= 18` is `False`.\n3. Python bypasses the `if` block and jumps directly to the `else` block to execute its statement.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Multi-way Selection (The `if-elif-else` Ladder)\n\nWhen a problem requires checking multiple distinct conditions, we use a multi-way structure. This allows for complex branching logic.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nif condition_1:\n    # runs if condition_1 is True\nelif condition_2:\n    # runs if condition_1 is False AND condition_2 is True\nelse:\n    # runs only if ALL previous conditions are False\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\ntemperature = 28\n\nif temperature > 35:\n    print(\"Climate: Extreme Heat\")\nelif temperature > 25:\n    print(\"Climate: Moderate\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Climate: Cool\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nClimate: Moderate\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1. **First Check**: `28 > 35` is `False`. Python moves to the next block.\n2. **Second Check**: `28 > 25` is `True`. Python prints \"Climate: Moderate\".\n3. **Pruning**: Because a `True` condition was found, Python skips the `else` block entirely. Only one path in the entire ladder is ever executed.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Key Architectural Rules\n- **Indentation**: In Python, indentation (4 spaces) defines the **scope** of the block. Incorrect indentation results in an `IndentationError`.\n- **The Colon (`:`)**: Use a colon at the end of every `if`, `elif`, and `else` header to indicate the start of a block.\n- **Mutual Exclusivity**: In a multi-way chain, as soon as one condition is met, the rest are ignored, even if they would also evaluate to `True`.",

                "content": "# 🎓 Lesson 8: Iterative Control Structures (The `for` Loop)\n\nIn computer architecture and algorithm design, **Iterative Control Structures** (or loops) allow for the repeated execution of a statement block based on a collection or range of values. The Python `for` loop is an **Iterative** loop, meaning it traverses over an iterable object rather than just evaluating a boolean condition.\n\n---\n\n## 📘 Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n1.  Define the mechanism of sequence traversal in Python.\n2.  Utilize the `range()` function for precise block repetition.\n3.  Implement granular control over iteration using start, stop, and step parameters.\n4.  Analyze the lifecycle of a loop variable during execution.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Iteration over a Numerical Range\n\nThe most common use of a `for` loop in algorithms is to repeat a task a specific number of times using the `range()` function. \n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nfor variable in range(limit):\n    # Statements to repeat\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(f\"Iteration Index: {i}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nIteration Index: 0\nIteration Index: 1\nIteration Index: 2\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  The `range(3)` function generates a sequence of integers: `[0, 1, 2]`.\n2.  In the first turn, the variable `i` is assigned `0`. The block executes.\n3.  Python automatically updates `i` to the next value in the sequence until the limit is reached.\n4.  **Note**: The ending value (3) is **exclusive**, meaning it stops exactly one before the limit.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Iteration over Sequences (Strings & Lists)\n\nPythonic loops excel at traversing data structures directly. Instead of using an index, the loop variable takes the value of each element in the collection.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nfor element in sequence:\n    # Statements utilizing the element\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nword = \"DATA\"\nfor char in word:\n    print(f\"Processing Character: {char}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nProcessing Character: D\nProcessing Character: A\nProcessing Character: T\nProcessing Character: A\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  Python treats the string `\"DATA\"` as a sequence of individual characters.\n2.  In each iteration, the variable `char` points to the next character in the string.\n3.  The loop terminates automatically once every element in the sequence has been visited.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Granular Control (The Step Parameter)\n\nFor more advanced algorithms, you may need to skip values or iterate in reverse. This is achieved by passing three arguments to the `range()` function: `range(start, stop, step)`.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nfor i in range(start, stop, step):\n    # Statements\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\n# Iterating from 2 to 10, skipping by 2 (Even numbers)\nfor num in range(2, 11, 2):\n    print(f\"Even Number: {num}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nEven Number: 2\nEven Number: 4\nEven Number: 6\nEven Number: 8\nEven Number: 10\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  `start=2`: The sequence begins at 2.\n2.  `stop=11`: The sequence will not exceed 10 (stops before 11).\n3.  `step=2`: Instead of adding 1, Python adds 2 to the variable after each iteration.\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Essential Summary & Rules\n- **Loop Variable**: This variable only exists to hold the \"current\" value of the iteration. It is updated automatically by Python.\n- **Off-by-One**: Always remember that `range(5)` results in 5 iterations, but the numbers run from **0 to 4**.\n- **Indentation**: Like selection structures, the entire \"body\" of the loop must be indented to define its scope.",

                "content": "# 🎓 Lesson 9: Conditional Repetition (The `while` Loop)\n\nIn programming, we often need to repeat a task, but we don't always know exactly how many times. The **`while` loop** is the perfect tool for this. It keeps running as long as a certain condition stays `True`. \n\n---\n\n## 📘 Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n1.  Understand how a loop runs based on a condition.\n2.  Write a basic `while` loop using the correct syntax.\n3.  Identify and prevent \"Infinite Loops\" (loops that never stop).\n4.  Know when to use `while` instead of `for`.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Basic `while` Loop\n\nA `while` loop acts like an `if` statement that repeats itself. Before every turn, Python asks: \"Is the condition still True?\"\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nwhile condition:\n    # code to run while condition is True\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\ncount = 1\n\nwhile count <= 3:\n    print(f\"Current Count: {count}\")\n    count = count + 1  # This update is very important!\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nCurrent Count: 1\nCurrent Count: 2\nCurrent Count: 3\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Preparation**: We start with `count = 1`.\n2.  **The Check**: Python checks if `1 <= 3`. Since it is `True`, it enters the loop.\n3.  **The Work**: It prints the message and then adds 1 to `count`. Now `count` is `2`.\n4.  **The Repeat**: It goes back to the top and checks `2 <= 3` (True) and then `3 <= 3` (True).\n5.  **The End**: When `count` becomes `4`, the check `4 <= 3` becomes `False`, and the loop stops immediately.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Danger: Infinite Loops\n\nIf you forget to update your variable (like forgetting `count = count + 1`), the condition will stay `True` forever. This is called an **Infinite Loop**.\n\n**Example of a \"Broken\" Loop:**\n```python\n# WARNING: This will never stop because count stays at 1\ncount = 1\nwhile count < 5:\n    print(\"I am stuck!\")\n```\n\n**How to fix it?** Always make sure something inside the loop changes so that the condition eventually becomes `False`.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Simple Rules for `while` Loops\n\n- **Entry-Controlled**: Python checks the condition **before** it ever runs the code inside. If the condition is `False` at the start, the loop is skipped entirely.\n- **The Colon (`:`)**: Never forget the colon at the end of the `while` line.\n- **Indentation**: Just like `if` and `for`, the repeated code must be pushed to the right (4 spaces).\n- **When to use?**: Use `for` loops when you know the total number of turns. Use `while` loops when you are waiting for something to happen (like a user typing \"exit\").",

                "content": "# 🎓 Lesson 10: Loop Control (break, continue, pass)\n\nSometimes, standard loops aren't enough. We might need to stop a loop early, skip a specific part, or create an empty space for future code. Python provides three powerful keywords for **Loop Control**: `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.\n\n---\n\n## 📘 Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n1.  Exit a loop immediately using the `break` statement.\n2.  Skip specific iterations using the `continue` statement.\n3.  Understand the role of `pass` as a syntactic placeholder.\n4.  Analyze how these keywords affect the execution pointer of a program.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The `break` Statement (The Exit Button)\n\nThe `break` statement is used to terminate a loop immediately. When Python hits a `break`, it stops the loop and jumps to the very next line of code outside the loop.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nwhile condition:\n    if trigger:\n        break\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\n# Stop searching after finding the lucky number\nfor num in range(1, 10):\n    if num == 5:\n        print(\"Found 5! Stopping the loop.\")\n        break\n    print(f\"Checking: {num}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nChecking: 1\nChecking: 2\nChecking: 3\nChecking: 4\nFound 5! Stopping the loop.\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  The loop starts normally, printing 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n2.  When `num` reaches 5, the `if` condition becomes `True`.\n3.  The `break` command is triggered, which kills the loop entirely.\n4.  Numbers 6 through 9 are never checked or printed.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The `continue` Statement (The Skip Button)\n\nUnlike `break`, the `continue` statement doesn't stop the loop. Instead, it stops the **current turn** and jumps straight back to the start of the next turn.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nfor item in sequence:\n    if condition_to_skip:\n        continue\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\n# Print only odd numbers by skipping even ones\nfor num in range(1, 6):\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        continue\n    print(f\"Odd Number: {num}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nOdd Number: 1\nOdd Number: 3\nOdd Number: 5\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  When `num` is 2 or 4, the condition `num % 2 == 0` is `True`.\n2.  The `continue` command triggers, skipping the `print` line below it.\n3.  Python jumps back to the top of the loop to try the next number in the range.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The `pass` Statement (The Placeholder)\n\nIn Python, you cannot have an empty block of code (like an empty `if` or `for`). If you aren't ready to write the logic yet, you use `pass` to tell Python: \"Do nothing, just move on.\"\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nfor i in range(5):\n    if i == 3:\n        pass  # TODO: Handle this specific case later\n    else:\n        print(i)\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  When `i` is 3, Python executes `pass`.\n2.  Absolutely nothing happens, and the program continues to the next line or turn.\n3.  It prevents the program from crashing due to an empty code block.\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Summary Table\n| Keyword | Action | Use Case |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **`break`** | Stops the loop forever | Exit early when a goal is met |\n| **`continue`** | Skips the current turn | Filter out specific values |\n| **`pass`** | Does nothing | Act as a temporary placeholder |",

                "content": "# 🎓 Lesson 11: Linear Data Structures (The `List`)\n\nIn computer science, a **List** is a fundamental data structure used to store a collection of items in a specific order. In Python, lists are highly flexible, as they can hold different types of data and grow or shrink as needed.\n\n---\n\n## 📘 Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n1.  Define and initialize a list using proper syntax.\n2.  Access and modify elements using **Zero-based Indexing**.\n3.  Extract specific portions of a list using **Slicing**.\n4.  Understand the concept of **Mutability** (the ability to change data).\n\n---\n\n## 1. List Creation and Indexing\n\nA list is defined by surrounding a collection of values with square brackets `[]`. Each item is separated by a comma.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nlist_name = [item1, item2, item3]\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\n# Creating a list of tech brands\nbrands = [\"Tesla\", \"Apple\", \"Google\"]\n\nprint(f\"First Brand: {brands[0]}\")\nprint(f\"Last Brand: {brands[-1]}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nFirst Brand: Tesla\nLast Brand: Google\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Storage**: Python stores these items in sequential order.\n2.  **Indexing**: Each item gets a position number called an index. The first item is always **0**, the second is **1**, and so on.\n3.  **Negative Indexing**: Python allows you to count from the end using negative numbers. `-1` is always the last item.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Mutability (Changing Data)\n\nLists are **mutable**, which is a fancy word for \"changeable.\" Unlike some other data types, you can update an item in a list without creating a new list.\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nnumbers = [10, 20, 30]\n\n# Changing the middle number\nnumbers[1] = 99\n\nprint(f\"Updated List: {numbers}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nUpdated List: [10, 99, 30]\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  Python finds the specific memory slot at index `1`.\n2.  It overwrites the old value (`20`) with the new value (`99`).\n3.  The list's identity remains the same, but its content has been updated.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Extracting Data with Slicing \n\nSlicing allows you to \"slice\" out a portion of a list to create a smaller sub-list.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nsub_list = main_list[start:stop]\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nvowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n\n# Extract from index 1 up to (but not including) index 4\nprint(f\"Slice: {vowels[1:4]}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nSlice: ['e', 'i', 'o']\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Start**: The slice begins at index `1` (`'e'`).\n2.  **Exclusive Stop**: The slice stops **before** index `4`. It does not include the item at index 4.\n3.  **Result**: You get a brand new list containing only the selected items.\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Essential Summary of Lists\n| Feature | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Ordered** | Items keep the exact position where you put them. |\n| **Mutable** | You can add, remove, or change items at any time. |\n| **Indexed** | Items are accessed using 0-based numbers (0, 1, 2...). |\n| **Heterogeneous** | A single list can hold strings, numbers, and booleans together. |",

                "content": "# 🎓 Lesson 12: List Manipulation (Methods)\n\nIn Python, lists come equipped with built-in functions called **Methods**. These methods allow you to dynamically modify your collection by adding, removing, or reordering items efficiently.\n\n---\n\n## 📘 Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n1.  Use methods to add items at the end or at specific positions.\n2.  Delete items using value-based or index-based removal.\n3.  Reorder list data using sorting techniques.\n4.  Distinguish between in-place modifications and return values.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Adding Items\n\nYou can expand a list using `.append()` or `.insert()`. \n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nlist.append(item)       # Adds to the end\nlist.insert(index, item)  # Adds at specific index\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\ncities = [\"New York\", \"London\"]\ncities.append(\"Tokyo\")\ncities.insert(1, \"Paris\")\n\nprint(f\"Updated Cities: {cities}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nUpdated Cities: ['New York', 'Paris', 'London', 'Tokyo']\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Append**: Python finds the next available slot in memory and places \"Tokyo\" there.\n2.  **Insert**: To place \"Paris\" at index 1, Python must shift \"London\" (and everything after it) one position to the right to make room.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Removing Items\n\nYou can remove items by their **value** using `.remove()` or by their **position** using `.pop()`.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nlist.remove(value) # Removes first occurrence of value\nremoved_item = list.pop(index) # Removes & returns item at index\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nitems = [\"Book\", \"Pen\", \"Pencil\"]\nitems.remove(\"Pen\")\nlast_one = items.pop() # Removes \"Pencil\" by default\n\nprint(f\"Remaining: {items}\")\nprint(f\"Popped: {last_one}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nRemaining: ['Book']\nPopped: Pencil\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Search**: `.remove()` scans the list from left-to-right until it finds the first match.\n2.  **Extraction**: `.pop()` extracts the value and closes the gap in the list, making it useful when you need to use the value you just deleted.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Organizing Data\n\nTo reorder items, we use the `.sort()` method. \n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nscores = [40, 10, 30]\nscores.sort()\n\nprint(f\"Sorted Scores: {scores}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nSorted Scores: [10, 30, 40]\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **In-Place Modification**: `.sort()` changes the **original** list forever. It does not create a copy.\n2.  **Logic**: Python compares items and swaps their positions until they are in ascending order.\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Method Summary Table\n| Method | Action | Effect on List |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **`.append(x)`** | Add `x` to end | List grows by 1 |\n| **`.insert(i, x)`** | Add `x` at index `i` | Items shift right |\n| **`.remove(x)`** | Delete first match of `x` | List shrinks by 1 |\n| **`.pop(i)`** | Remove and return item `i` | Gap is filled |\n| **`.sort()`** | Sort items ascending | Order changes in-place |",

Like lists, items are accessed using 0-based indexing.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\ntuple_name = (item1, item2, item3)\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\n# Storing fixed scientific constants\nconstants = (3.14, 9.8, 1.61)\n\nprint(f\"Pi: {constants[0]}\")\nprint(f\"Gravity: {constants[1]}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nPi: 3.14\nGravity: 9.8\n```\n\n**⚠️ The Single-Item Rule:**\nTo create a tuple with only one item, you **must** include a trailing comma. Without it, Python treats the parentheses as a simple grouping operator for the data type inside (like an integer or string).\n```python\nwrong = (\"Apple\")  # This is a String!\nright = (\"Apple\",) # This is a Tuple!\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Mechanics of Immutability\n\nOnce a tuple is created, its items cannot be replaced, added, or removed. This property is known as **Immutability**.\n\n**Example Code (Failure Case):**\n```python\ncolors = (\"Red\", \"Blue\")\n\n# This will trigger an error!\ntry:\n    colors[0] = \"Green\"\nexcept TypeError as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Memory Protection**: Python locks the memory block where the tuple is stored. \n2.  **Reference Stability**: Since the content cannot change, the memory addresses remain constant, making tuples safer for multi-threaded programming or as keys in dictionaries.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Lists vs. Tuples: When to use which?\n\n| Feature | List (`[]`) | Tuple (`()`) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Mutability** | Mutable (Changeable) | Immutable (Constant) |\n| **Speed** | Slower | Faster |\n| **Memory** | Uses more memory (for growth) | Uses less memory (exact fit) |\n| **Usage** | Collections of similar items | Grouping related data (Records) |\n\n**Use a Tuple when:** You have a fixed collection of items that should act as a single \"record\" (e.g., coordinates `(x, y)`, or an RGB color value `(255, 0, 0)`).\n\n**Use a List when:** You expect the data to grow or change during the program's execution.\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Essential Summary\n- Tuples are faster and safer than lists for constant data.\n- They use parentheses `()` and require a comma for single items.\n- They prevent accidental data corruption by being read-only.",

                "content": "# 🎓 Lesson 14: Non-Linear Collections (The `Set`)\n\nIn computer science, a **Set** is an unordered collection of elements that guarantees **uniqueness**. Unlike lists or tuples, sets are modeled after the mathematical concept of a set, where the order of elements does not matter and duplicates are strictly prohibited.\n\n---\n\n## 📘 Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n1.  Initialize sets and understand the automatic filtering of duplicates.\n2.  Perform formal **Mathematical Set Operations** (Union, Intersection, Difference).\n3.  Modify sets using `add()` and `remove()` methods.\n4.  Explain the technical role of **Hashing** in set performance.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Defining Sets and Ensuring Uniqueness\n\nSets are defined using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor. If you provide a collection with duplicates, Python automatically collapses them into a single unique entry.\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\n# Filtering duplicates from a registration list\nguests = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Alice\", \"Charlie\"}\n\nprint(f\"Unique Guests: {guests}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nUnique Guests: {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'}\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **De-duplication**: When Python encounters the second \"Alice\", it checks its internal registry. Seeing a match, it simply ignores the new entry.\n2.  **Unordered Nature**: Because sets are unordered, you **cannot** use indexing like `guests[0]`.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Mathematical Set Operations\n\nOne of the most powerful features of sets is their ability to perform high-speed comparisons between multiple collections.\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nset_a = {1, 2, 3}\nset_b = {3, 4, 5}\n\nprint(f\"Union: {set_a | set_b}\")\nprint(f\"Intersection: {set_a & set_b}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nUnion: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nIntersection: {3}\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Union (`|`)**: Combines all unique items from both sets. The number 3 appears only once in the result.\n2.  **Intersection (`&`)**: Identifies items that exist in **both** sets. Only 3 is shared here.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Modifying Sets\n\nSets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove items after creation. However, because they are unordered, the methods differ from lists.\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\ntools = {\"Hammer\", \"Saw\"}\n\n# Adding a new item\ntools.add(\"Drill\")\n\n# Removing an item\ntools.remove(\"Saw\")\n\nprint(f\"Toolbox: {tools}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nToolbox: {'Hammer', 'Drill'}\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **`add()`**: Inserts an item into the collection. If the item already exists, nothing happens.\n2.  **`remove()`**: Deletes a specific item. If the item is not found, Python will raise an error.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Power of Hashing (Membership Testing)\n\nSets are optimized for checking if an item exists within a collection—a task called **Membership Testing**.\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nnames = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"}\n\n# Check if Alice is in the set\npresent = \"Alice\" in names\n\nprint(f\"Is Alice here? {present}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nIs Alice here? True\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Direct Lookup**: Instead of scanning a list one-by-one, Python calculates a **Hash Value** (a unique ID) for \"Alice\".\n2.  **Instant Recall**: It goes directly to the memory address corresponding to that ID. This makes membership testing **instantaneous**, regardless of whether you have 10 names or 10 million.\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Essential Summary\n| Feature | Set Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Uniqueness** | Automatically removes any duplicate items. |\n| **Unordered** | Items have no index; order is not guaranteed. |\n| **Operations** | Fast math comparisons (Union, Intersection). |\n| **Performance** | Membership testing via Hashing is extremely fast. |",

                "content": "# 🎓 Lesson 15: Map Data Structures (The `Dictionary`)\n\nIn computer science, a **Dictionary** (or Map) is an associative data structure that stores data in **Key-Value Pairs**. It is designed for high-speed retrieval of information by providing a unique \"Key\" to look up a corresponding \"Value,\" similar to how a real-world dictionary maps a word to its definition.\n\n---\n\n## 📘 Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n1.  Define and initialize dictionaries using curly-brace syntax.\n2.  Access and update values using unique keys.\n3.  Use methods like `.get()`, `.keys()`, and `.values()` for safe data manipulation.\n4.  Understand the underlying **Hash Table** mechanics that make dictionaries fast.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Key-Value Pairing and Creation\n\nA dictionary is a collection of pairs separated by a colon (`:`). The **Key** is the unique identifier, and the **Value** is the data associated with it.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\ndictionary_name = { \"key\": value, \"key2\": value2 }\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\n# Storing a user profile\nuser = {\n    \"username\": \"codemaster\",\n    \"level\": 42,\n    \"is_active\": True\n}\n\nprint(f\"User: {user['username']}\")\nprint(f\"Account Level: {user['level']}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nUser: codemaster\nAccount Level: 42\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Keys must be Immutable**: You can use strings, numbers, or tuples as keys, but you cannot use lists because keys must never change.\n2.  **Unordered Retrieval**: Unlike lists, dictionaries do not rely on numerical positions (0, 1, 2). You jump directly to the data using the Key.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Mutability and Safe Access\n\nDictionaries are **mutable**, meaning you can add new pairs or update existing values. To avoid program crashes from missing keys, Python provides the `.get()` method.\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nprices = {\"Apple\": 0.5}\n\n# Updating an existing value\nprices[\"Apple\"] = 0.75\n\n# Adding a new pair\nprices[\"Banana\"] = 0.30\n\n# Safe access (prevents error if key is missing)\npear_price = prices.get(\"Pear\", \"Not Found\")\n\nprint(f\"Updated Prices: {prices}\")\nprint(f\"Pear price: {pear_price}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nUpdated Prices: {'Apple': 0.75, 'Banana': 0.3}\nPear price: Not Found\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Direct Assignment**: Using `prices[\"name\"] = value` either updates the existing key or creates it if it doesn't exist.\n2.  **The `.get()` Guard**: While `prices[\"Pear\"]` would crash the program with a `KeyError`, `.get()` returns `None` (or a custom message) if the key is missing.\n\n---\n\n## 3. High-Speed Mapping (Hash Tables)\n\nDictionaries are among the fastest data structures in Python because they use **Hash Tables**.\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Hashing**: When you provide a key, Python runs it through a mathematical \"Hash Function\" to generate a unique index.\n2.  **O(1) Performance**: This index points directly to the memory address of the value. Because of this, looking up a key takes the same amount of time regardless of whether the dictionary has 10 items or 10 million items.\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Essential Summary\n| Method | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **`.keys()`** | Returns a list-like collection of all keys in the dictionary. |\n| **`.values()`** | Returns a collection of all values only. |\n| **`.items()`** | Returns all key-value pairs as a list of tuples. |\n| **`.get(k, d)`** | Safely returns value for key `k`, or default `d` if not found. |",

                "content": "# 🎓 Lesson 16: Modular Programming (Introduction to `Functions`)\n\nIn computer science, a **Function** is a self-contained block of statements that performs a specific task. By isolating logic into functions, we achieve **Modular Programming**, making code easier to read, test, and maintain.\n\n---\n\n## 📘 Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n1.  Define a function using the `def` keyword.\n2.  Distinguish between a **Function Definition** and a **Function Call**.\n3.  Apply the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle to improve code quality.\n4.  Analyze the **Execution Flow** when a function is invoked.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Function Definition and Invocation\n\nA function must be defined (created) before it can be invoked (run). The definition describes the task, while the call executes it.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\n# Definition\ndef function_name():\n    # Block of code (The Task)\n\n# Call (Invocation)\nfunction_name()\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\ndef display_banner():\n    print(\"====================\")\n    print(\" SYSTEM INITIALIZED \")\n    print(\"====================\")\n\n# Executing the task\ndisplay_banner()\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\n====================\n SYSTEM INITIALIZED \n====================\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Preparation**: Python reads the `def` block and stores the code in memory. It is **not executed** yet.\n2.  **Trigger**: When Python sees `display_banner()`, it jumps to the stored location, runs the code inside, and then returns to the next line.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Reusability (The DRY Principle)\n\nDRY stands for **Don't Repeat Yourself**. Instead of writing complex logic multiple times, you package it into a function and reuse it.\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\ndef log_event():\n    print(\"[LOG]: Action performed.\")\n\n# Instead of printing 3 times manually...\nlog_event()\nlog_event()\nlog_event()\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\n[LOG]: Action performed.\n[LOG]: Action performed.\n[LOG]: Action performed.\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Consistency**: If you decide to change \"[LOG]\" to \"[INFO]\", you only change it once in the definition.\n2.  **Efficiency**: Reusing the function reduces the number of lines in your main program, lowering the chance of syntax errors.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Execution Flow\n\nUnderstanding the \"Jump and Return\" logic is crucial for debugging complex programs.\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Steps):**\n1.  **Definition**: Python registers the name `function_name`.\n2.  **Invocation**: The program execution pointer jumps to the function's first line.\n3.  **Completion**: Once the last indented line of the function is finished, the pointer jumps back to exactly where it was before the call.\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Essential Summary\n- Functions are the building blocks of reusable code.\n- `def` is used to define, while `()` is used to call.\n- Modularity: breaking a big problem into small, functional pieces.\n- Indentation identifies which lines belong to the function body.",

                "content": "# 🎓 Lesson 17: Passing Information (Function Arguments)\n\nA function's power lies in its ability to process different data each time it is called. External data is passed into a function via **Arguments** (values sent during the call) which fill the **Parameters** (variables defined in the function header).\n\n---\n\n## 📘 Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n1.  Pass data using **Positional Arguments**.\n2.  Eliminate order-dependency using **Keyword Arguments**.\n3.  Provide fallback values with **Default Parameters**.\n4.  Identify and fix parameter count mismatches.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Positional Arguments\n\nPositional arguments are the most common type. Python matches each argument in the call to a parameter in the definition based on their **position (order)**.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\n# Definition\ndef function(param1, param2):\n    # logic\n\n# Call\nfunction(value1, value2)\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\ndef describe_pet(animal_type, name):\n    print(f\"I have a {animal_type} named {name}.\")\n\n# 'Hamster' matches animal_type, 'Harry' matches name\ndescribe_pet(\"Hamster\", \"Harry\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nI have a Hamster named Harry.\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Matching**: Python maps the first value (`\"Hamster\"`) to the first parameter (`animal_type`).\n2.  **Logic**: If you swapped them—`describe_pet(\"Harry\", \"Hamster\")`—the output would incorrectly say \"I have a Harry named Hamster.\"\n\n---\n\n## 2. Keyword Arguments\n\nWith keyword arguments, you explicitly pair the value with the parameter name during the call. This removes the need to worry about order.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nfunction(param_name=value)\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\ndef describe_pet(animal_type, name):\n    print(f\"I have a {animal_type} named {name}.\")\n\n# Order doesn't matter when parameters are named\ndescribe_pet(name=\"Whiskers\", animal_type=\"Cat\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nI have a Cat named Whiskers.\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Binding**: Python sees `name=\"Whiskers\"` and binds that value to the `name` variable immediately, regardless of where it appears in the list.\n2.  **Safety**: This makes code more readable for functions with many inputs.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Default Arguments\n\nYou can set a default value for a parameter. If the user doesn't provide an argument during the call, Python uses this fallback value.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\ndef function(param=\"default_value\"):\n    # logic\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\ndef greet(name, message=\"Welcome!\"):\n    print(f\"Hello {name}, {message}\")\n\ngreet(\"Alex\")                # Uses default\ngreet(\"Bob\", \"Good Morning\")  # Overwrites default\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nHello Alex, Welcome!\nHello Bob, Good Morning\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Initial assignment**: When `greet(\"Alex\")` is called, Python sees only one value. It assigns it to `name` and checked if `message` has a default. Since it does, it uses `\"Welcome!\"`.\n2.  **Requirement Rule**: Default parameters **must** always follow non-default parameters in the function definition header.\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Essential Rules & Summary\n- **Requirement**: Non-default arguments are mandatory. Missing one triggers a `TypeError`.\n- **Order**: Default parameters must be on the right (end) of the parameter list.\n- **Clarity**: Use Keyword arguments for complex functions to make your code \"self-documenting.\"",

                "content": "# 🎓 Lesson 18: Outputting Data (The `return` Statement)\n\nA function doesn't just process information; it can also produce a result that the rest of your program can use. The **`return`** statement is the mechanism used to send a value from inside a function back to the line of code that invoked it.\n\n---\n\n## 📘 Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n1.  Distinguish between **Displaying** data (`print`) and **Returning** data (`return`).\n2.  Use the `return` keyword to pass calculations back to the caller.\n3.  Implement multiple `return` statements for conditional logic.\n4.  Explain how `return` acts as an **Immediate Terminator** for function execution.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Power of Returning Values\n\nWhile `print()` shows a message to the user, `return` sends data into a variable or a further calculation. Without `return`, the result of a function is lost once the function finishes.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\ndef function_name():\n    return value\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(price):\n    return price * 0.05\n\n# The value '5.0' is sent back and stored in 'tax_amount'\ntax_amount = calculate_tax(100)\nfinal_total = 100 + tax_amount\n\nprint(f\"Final price: {final_total}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nFinal price: 105.0\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Handover**: When Python hits `return`, it literally hands the numeric result to the variable `tax_amount`.\n2.  **Continuity**: This allows the program to continue working with the data for logic like `final_total`.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Print vs. Return: The Key Difference\n\n| Feature | `print()` | `return` |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Purpose** | To show info to the human user. | To provide data to the computer program. |\n| **Persistence** | Data is shown and then vanishes. | Data can be stored in variables for later. |\n| **Effect** | Does not stop the function. | Immediately stops the function execution. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Function Termination (Early Exit)\n\nThe `return` statement serves two purposes: it gives back a value, and it **aborts** the function immediately. Any code written after a `return` is executed is called \"Unreachable Code.\"\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\ndef check_access(age):\n    if age < 18:\n        return \"Access Denied\"\n    \n    # This only runs if the 'return' above was skipped\n    print(\"Logging entry...\")\n    return \"Welcome!\"\n\nstatus = check_access(15)\nprint(status)\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\nAccess Denied\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Abortion**: Since the age (15) is less than 18, the first `return` is hit. Python immediately stops and ignores the \"Logging entry\" line.\n2.  **Implicit Return**: If a function finishes without hitting a `return` statement, it secretly returns the value `None`.\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Essential Summary\n- `return` sends a value back and ends the function.\n- Any code after a `return` statement in the same block will NOT run.\n- You can return multiple values by separating them with commas (e.g., `return x, y`).\n- Use `return` when you need the result for another part of your code.",

                "content": "# 🎓 Lesson 19: Anonymous Expressions (Lambda Functions)\n\nIn Python, a **Lambda Function** is a small, throw-away function that is defined without a name. These are often called \"Anonymous Functions\" and are used for short durations of logic where a full `def` statement would be unnecessary and verbose.\n\n---\n\n## 📘 Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n1.  Define the structure of a **Lambda (Anonymous) Function**.\n2.  Utilize **Implicit Returns** (expressions that evaluate automatically).\n3.  Integrate lambdas with higher-order built-in functions: `filter()`, `map()`, and `sorted()`.\n4.  Evaluate when to use a lambda versus a standard `def` function.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Syntax of Anonymity\n\nUnlike traditional functions, a lambda is a single-line expression. It can take any number of arguments but can only contain **one** expression of logic.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nlambda arguments: expression\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\n# Lambda Version (Anonymous)\nsquare_lambda = lambda x: x * x\n\nprint(square_lambda(5))\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\n25\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Immediacy**: Python evaluates the expression `x * x` and **automatically returns** it. You do not write the `return` keyword.\n2.  **Assignment**: While lambdas are meant to be anonymous, you can assign them to a variable to use them like a regular function.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Standard Functions vs. Lambda Functions\n\n| Feature | `def` Function | `lambda` Function |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Syntax** | Multiple lines + `def` keyword. | Single line + `lambda` keyword. |\n| **Return** | Requires explicit `return` keyword. | Implicitly returns the expression result. |\n| **Use Case** | Reusable logic, complex operations. | Short, throw-away logic. |\n| **Naming** | Must have a name. | Anonymous (can exist without a name). |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Using Lambda with `filter()` and `map()`\n\nLambdas are most powerful when passed as arguments to higher-order functions like `filter()` (selecting items) and `map()` (transforming items).\n\n### A. The `filter()` Function\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nfilter(lambda parameter: condition, iterable)\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nevens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\nprint(evens)\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\n[2, 4, 6]\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works:** The `filter()` function executes the lambda for every item. Only items where the lambda returns `True` are kept.\n\n### B. The `map()` Function\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nmap(lambda parameter: transformation, iterable)\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3]\ndoubled = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))\nprint(doubled)\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\n[2, 4, 6]\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works:** The `map()` function applies the transformation logic in the lambda to **every** item in the list.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Custom Sorting with `sorted()`\n\nYou can use a lambda to tell Python **how** to sort complex data, such as a list of tuples or dictionaries.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nsorted(iterable, key=lambda parameter: sorting_logic)\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\n# Sorting students by their grade (the 2nd item in the tuple)\nstudents = [(\"Alex\", 85), (\"Bob\", 75), (\"Charlie\", 95)]\n\nsorted_students = sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[1])\n\nprint(sorted_students)\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```text\n[('Bob', 75), ('Alex', 85), ('Charlie', 95)]\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works (Explanation):**\n1.  **Key Extraction**: The `key` parameter expects a function. The lambda `student: student[1]` acts as this function, grabbing the numerical grade from each student tuple.\n2.  **Evaluation**: Python compares these extracted grades instead of the entire tuples to determine the final order.\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Essential Summary\n- Lambdas are limited to a **single expression** (one line of logic).\n- Use `filter()` to select data and `map()` to change data.\n- Use the `key=` argument in `sorted()` to define custom ordering logic.\n- Avoid using lambdas for complex logic; readability is always more important than brevity.",

Modules help organize code and avoid repetition.\n\n**Advantages of Modules:**\n- Reuse code in multiple programs.\n- Easier debugging.\n- Better program structure.\n- **Namespace management**: Avoids name conflicts using the dot (.) operator.\n\n### Creating a Module\n**File: math_module.py**\n```python\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\ndef sub(a, b):\n    return a - b\n```\n\n### Using a Module\n- **Import Entire Module**: `import math_module` -> `print(math_module.add(10, 5))`\n- **Import Specific Members**: `from math_module import add` -> `print(add(10, 5))`\n- **Import with Alias**: `import math_module as m` -> `print(m.sub(10, 5))`\n\n**Built-in Modules:** Python provides many modules out-of-the-box like `math`, `sys`, `os`, `random`, and `datetime`.\n```python\nimport math\nprint(math.sqrt(25)) # Output: 5.0\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Packages in Python\n\nA **Package** is a collection of related modules organized in a directory (folder). A package may contain sub-packages and modules.\n\n**Package Structure:**\n```text\nmypackage/\n│\n├── __init__.py    # Marks the directory as a package\n├── module1.py\n└── module2.py\n```\n\n**🔍 Purpose of `__init__.py`:**\n- Marks the directory as a package.\n- Can initialize package-level code.\n- Can control what is imported.\n\n### Creating and Using a Package\n**Structure:**\n- calculator/\n  - __init__.py\n  - add.py (contains `def add(a, b):`)\n  - sub.py (contains `def sub(a, b):`)\n\n**Usage:**\n```python\nfrom calculator import add\nprint(add.add(10, 5))\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Module vs. Package\n\n| Feature | Module | Package |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Definition** | Single .py file | Folder containing modules |\n| **Content** | Code (functions/classes) | Modules and sub-packages |\n| **Unit Size** | Small unit | Large, structural unit |\n| **Creation** | Easy (just a file) | Structured (needs folder + __init__.py) |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Third-Party Packages\n\nYou can install third-party packages created by the community using the **pip** command in your terminal.\n\n**Example:** `pip install numpy`\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Conclusion\n- **Module** -> single Python file.\n- **Package** -> collection of modules.\n- Both improve code organization and are essential for building large-scale applications.",

                "content": "# 🎓 Lesson 21: Advanced Strings (Indexing, Slicing, and Formatting)\n\nIn Python, a **String** is not just a piece of text but a **Sequence** of Unicode characters. This structural characteristic allows us to treat strings as ordered data collections, similar to lists, enabling powerful manipulation techniques.\n\n---\n\n## 📘 Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n1.  Navigate strings using **Zero-based** and **Negative Indexing**.\n2.  Extract substrings using the **Slicing Syntax** (`start:stop:step`).\n3.  Explain the **Memory Mechanics** of String Immutability.\n4.  Utilize **Traversal** techniques to process characters.\n5.  Implement modern string formatting using **f-strings** and `.format()`.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Indexing: Accessing Characters\n\nEvery character in a string occupies a specific position called an **Index**. Python supports two-way indexing.\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n- **Zero-based (Positive)**: `0` to `len-1` (Left to Right).\n- **Negative Indexing**: `-1` to `-len` (Right to Left).\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\ntext = \"PYTHON\"\nprint(text[0])   # First character: 'P'\nprint(text[-1])  # Last character: 'N'\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Slicing: Extracting Substrings\n\nSlicing allows you to extract a range of characters. It follows a specific mathematical rule: the **stop** index is **exclusive** (not included).\n\n**Formal Syntax:**\n```python\nstring[start : stop : step]\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nmessage = \"Programming\"\n\n# Extract 'Pro'\nprint(message[0:3]) \n\n# Extract every second character\nprint(message[::2]) \n\n# Reverse the string\nprint(message[::-1])\n```\n\n**🔍 How it Works:** \n1.  `[0:3]` starts at index 0 and stops *before* index 3.\n2.  `[::-1]` uses a negative step to traverse the sequence backward.\n\n---\n\n## 3. String Immutability (Memory Concept)\n\nStrings are **Immutable**. This means once a string object is created in memory, its contents **cannot be altered**. \n\n**Technical Execution:**\n```python\nword = \"Hello\"\n# word[0] = \"J\"  # This triggers a TypeError\n\n# Correct way: Create a NEW string\nword = \"J\" + word[1:]\nprint(word) # \"Jello\"\n```\n\n**🔍 Memory Note:** Python uses **String Interning** for small strings. If two variables have the same value, they may point to the same memory address to optimize performance.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Traversing Strings\n\nTraversing means visiting every character in the string one by one, usually for processing or filtering.\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nphrase = \"Python\"\nfor char in phrase:\n    print(char.upper(), end=\"-\")\n```\n\n**Expected Output:** `P-Y-T-H-O-N-`\n\n---\n\n## 5. Important String Methods\n\n| Method | Purpose | Example |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `.strip()` | Removes leading/trailing whitespace. | `\"  hi  \".strip()` -> `\"hi\"` |\n| `.replace(old, new)` | Swaps occurrences of text. | `\"cats\".replace(\"c\", \"b\")` -> `\"bats\"` |\n| `.split(sep)` | Breaks string into a list. | `\"A,B\".split(\",\")` -> `[\"A\", \"B\"]` |\n| `.join(list)` | Merges list items into a string. | `\"-\".join([\"A\", \"B\"])` -> `\"A-B\"` |\n\n---\n\n## 6. String Formatting\n\nFormatting allows you to inject variables into templates dynamically.\n\n**A. The `.format()` Method**\n```python\nage = 25\nprint(\"I am {} years old\".format(age))\n```\n\n**B. f-Strings (Recommended)**\nIntroduced in Python 3.6, **f-strings** are faster and more readable.\n```python\nname = \"Alex\"\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Common Errors & Exceptions\n1.  **IndexError**: Attempting to access an index that doesn't exist (e.g., `\"Hi\"[5]`).\n2.  **TypeError**: Attempting to modify a character directly (Immutability violation).\n\n---\n\n## 📈 Essential Summary\n- Strings are **ordered sequences** of characters.\n- Use **Negative Indexing** to access data from the end.\n- Slicing syntax is `[start : stop : step]`.\n- Strings are **Immutable**; use methods to generate NEW strings.",

                "content": "# 🛠️ Essential String Methods\n\nPython provides a massive library of methods to transform and clean up text. These are crucial for processing user data like emails or names.\n\n### Transformation Methods\n- `.upper()`: MAKES EVERYTHING CAPITAL.\n- `.lower()`: makes everything lowercase.\n- `.title()`: Capitalizes The First Letter Of Each Word.\n- `.strip()`: Removes spaces from the start and end (very useful for cleaning user input!).\n\n### Search & Replace Methods\n- `.replace(\"old\", \"new\")`: Swaps any occurrences of a word.\n- `.find(\"x\")`: Tells you the index where \"x\" starts.\n- `.split(\",\")`: Breaks a string into a **List**, using the comma as a separator.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\ndata = \" apples, oranges, bananas \"\nclean_data = data.strip().split(\", \")\nprint(clean_data) # ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas']\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works\nEvery time you call a method like `.upper()`, Python reads the original string, calculates the new uppercase version, and returns a **completely new string object**. The original string remains untouched because of immutability.\n\n### Practical Example: Email Formatting\nUsers often enter emails with random spaces or capital letters. You can fix them all in one line:\n```python\nemail = \"  John.DOE@gmail.com \"\nformatted_email = email.strip().lower()\n```\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Forgetting parentheses**: Writing `name.upper` instead of `name.upper()`.\n- **Expecting in-place change**: Writing `name.strip()` and expecting `name` to change. You must save it: `name = name.strip()`.\n\n### What to Remember\n- Methods return a NEW string.\n- `.strip()` is the gold standard for cleaning inputs.\n- `.split()` and `.join()` are the most powerful ways to convert between strings and lists.",

Now, we use the `with` block. It automatically closes the file for you, even if your program crashes!\n\n### Writing to a File\n```python\nwith open(\"notes.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n    file.write(\"Hello from GenSpark!\\n\")\n    file.write(\"Learning Python is fun.\")\n```\n- `\"w\"` (Write): Overwrites the file. If it doesn't exist, it creates it.\n- `\"a\"` (Append): Adds text to the end of the existing file.\n\n### Reading from a File\n```python\nwith open(\"notes.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    content = file.read()\n    print(content)\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works\n1. `open()`: Python asks the Operating System (Windows/Mac) for permission to access the file.\n2. **Handshake**: The OS gives Python a \"file pointer\".\n3. **Buffer**: Data isn't written directly to the disk character-by-character (that would be slow). Python stores it in a \"Buffer\" (memory) and writes it in chunks.\n4. **Context Manager**: The `with` statement ensures the OS releases the file so other programs can use it.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Overwriting with \"w\"**: Using `\"w\"` when you actually wanted to append `\"a\"`. Say goodbye to your old data!\n- **File Paths**: Trying to open a file that is in a different folder without giving the full path.\n\n### What to Remember\n- `r` = Read, `w` = Write, `a` = Append.\n- Always use `with open(...)` to avoid corrupted files.\n- Writing text usually needs `\\n` at the end for a new line.",

It looks for commas and creates a **List** for every line in the file.\n2. **Efficiency**: It reads the file line-by-line, so you can process a file with 1 million rows without running out of RAM.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Missing Newline Parameter**: When writing CSVs, always include `newline=''`. If you don't, some computers (like Windows) might add an extra blank line between every row.\n- **Assuming Index 0**: If your CSV has a header (titles), `row[0]` might be the word \"Name\" instead of the first student's name.\n\n### What to Remember\n- Import `csv` before use.\n- Every row in a CSV is returned as a **List** of strings.\n- Use `DictReader` if you want to access columns by their name instead of position.",

Instead of writing a long list of instructions, we create \"Objects\" that have their own data and behaviors.\n\n### Why OOP Exists?\nImagine building a car. You don't just have a pile of metal and rubber. You have distinct parts: an Engine, Wheels, and Steering. Each part has its own job. OOP lets us build software the same way, using **Blueprints**.\n\n### Core Concepts\n1. **Class**: The blueprint (the drawing of the car).\n2. **Object**: The actual car built from that blueprint.\n\n### Real-Life Analogy: The Cake Recipe\n- **The Recipe**: This is the **Class**. It tells you what ingredients are needed and how to bake. It's not a cake itself; it's the *idea* of a cake.\n- **The Actual Cake**: This is the **Object**. You can use one recipe to bake 10 different cakes. Some might be chocolate, some vanilla, but they all follow the same structure.\n\n### 🔍 How it Works\nOOP helps in **Encapsulation** (hiding complex internal details) and **Abstraction** (showing only what is necessary). It makes large projects much easier to manage because you can fix the \"Engine\" without breaking the \"Wheels\".\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Thinking OOP is always better**: For tiny scripts, regular \"procedural\" code is often faster and simpler.\n- **Over-complicating**: Creating classes for things that don't really need them.\n\n### What to Remember\n- A **Class** is a blueprint.\n- An **Object** is an instance of that class.\n- OOP is about organizing data and functions together into logical units.",

                "content": "# 📝 Classes & Objects in Python\n\nIn Python, everything is an object (even numbers and strings!). But now, you will learn how to create your own types of objects.\n\n### Creating a Class\nWe use the `class` keyword. By convention, class names start with a Capital Letter (**PascalCase**).\n\n```python\nclass Car:\n    brand = \"Toyota\"\n\n# Creating an Object\nmy_car = Car()\nprint(my_car.brand) # Toyota\n```\n\n### Adding Behavior (Methods)\nFunctions inside a class are called **Methods**. Every method must take `self` as its first argument.\n\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    def bark(self):\n        print(\"Woof! Woof!\")\n\nmy_dog = Dog()\nmy_dog.bark()\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works (The 'self' Secret)\n`self` represents the specific object you are working with. When you call `my_dog.bark()`, Python secretly converts it to `Dog.bark(my_dog)`. The `self` parameter allows the method to access data belonging to that specific dog.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Forgetting `self`**: Writing `def bark():` inside a class will cause an error when you try to call it from an object.\n- **Missing Parentheses**: Writing `my_car = Car` (without `()`) just gives you the class itself, not a new object.\n\n### What to Remember\n- Classes define structure; Objects store data.\n- Methods are just functions inside classes.\n- `self` is the key to connecting methods to objects.",

We use a special method called `__init__` for this.\n\n### What is a Constructor?\nit is an \"Initializor\". It runs **automatically** the moment an object is created.\n\n```python\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, grade):\n        self.name = name\n        self.grade = grade\n\ns1 = Student(\"Alice\", 10)\nprint(s1.name) # Alice\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works\n1. `s1 = Student(\"Alice\", 10)`: Python creates a blank object.\n2. It immediately calls the `__init__` method.\n3. `self.name = name`: This line takes the input \"Alice\" and \"sticks\" it onto the new object as a property called `name`.\n\n### Purpose of Constructor\n- **Setup**: Ensures the object is \"born\" with all the data it needs to function.\n- **Validation**: You can check if the data is correct before creating the object.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Misspelling `__init__`**: It has **two** underscores on each side. `_init_` or `__init_` will not work.\n- **Returning values**: `__init__` is NOT allowed to return anything. It only initializes.\n\n### What to Remember\n- `__init__` is the constructor.\n- It runs automatically at creation.\n- Use it to set \"Instance Variables\" (unique data for that object).",

Some data belongs to a **specific object**, and some data belongs to the **entire class**.\n\n### 1. Instance Variables\nThese are unique to each object. If I have 100 students, each has their own `name`.\n\n```python\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name # Instance Variable\n```\n\n### 2. Class Variables\nThese are shared by ALL objects of that class. For example, all students belong to the same \"School Name\".\n\n```python\nclass Student:\n    school = \"GenSpark High\" # Class Variable\n\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\ns1 = Student(\"Alice\")\ns2 = Student(\"Bob\")\nprint(s1.school) # GenSpark High\nprint(s2.school) # GenSpark High\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works\n- **Instance Variables** are stored inside the individual object's dictionary.\n- **Class Variables** are stored once inside the Class definition. If you change a class variable (`Student.school = \"University\"`), **all** objects will see the change immediately!\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Accidentally overriding**: If you do `s1.school = \"Other\"`, Python creates a *new* instance variable for Alice only, instead of changing the school for everyone.\n- **Wasting Memory**: Putting data that is the same for everyone into the `__init__` (instance) instead of making it a class variable.\n\n### What to Remember\n- Class variables are defined outside `__init__`.\n- Instance variables use `self.` inside `__init__`.\n- Change class variables using the Class name: `MyClass.variable = value`.",

This is the key to **Code Reuse**.\n\n### Parent and Child Classes\n```python\nclass Animal: # Parent\n    def breathe(self):\n        print(\"Breathing...\")\n\nclass Dog(Animal): # Child - Inherits from Animal\n    def bark(self):\n        print(\"Woof!\")\n\nmy_dog = Dog()\nmy_dog.breathe() # Inherited from Parent!\nmy_dog.bark() # Own method\n```\n\n### The super() Function\nUse `super()` to call a method from the parent class inside the child class. This is common in constructors.\n\n```python\nclass Pet(Animal):\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        super().__init__() # Call Parent's initialization\n        self.name = name\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works (The Chain)\nWhen you call a method, Python looks for it in the Child class. If it's not there, it looks in the Parent class. This is called the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Repeating Code**: Writing the same logic in five related classes instead of one parent class.\n- **Circular Inheritance**: Class A inherits from B, and B inherits from A. This will crash Python.\n\n### What to Remember\n- Child classes go inside parentheses: `class Child(Parent):`.\n- Use inheritance to avoid \"copy-pasting\" code across similar objects.",

This is often called **Duck Typing**: \"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.\"\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Inconsistent Names**: Naming it `speak()` in one class and `talk()` in another. This prevents you from using them interchangeably.\n- **Calling Parent unnecessarily**: Sometimes beginners forget they can override and try to make complex `if/else` checks instead.\n\n### What to Remember\n- Polymorphism allows different objects to share the same \"interface\" (method name).\n- It makes your code much more flexible and easy to extend.",

                "content": "# 🛡️ Encapsulation: Hiding Secrets\n\n**Encapsulation** is the art of bundling data and methods into a single unit (the class) and **restricting access** to the internal details. This protects your data from being accidentally changed in a bad way.\n\n### Private Variables\nIn Python, we use a **Double Underscore** `__` to mark a variable as \"Private\".\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, balance):\n        self.__balance = balance # Private\n\n    def get_balance(self):\n        return self.__balance\n\nacc = BankAccount(1000)\n# print(acc.__balance) # ERROR! Access denied\nprint(acc.get_balance()) # Success!\n```\n\n### Why use Encapsulation?\n1. **Data Safety**: You can add checks. Before reducing `__balance`, you can check if the user has enough money.\n2. **Cleanliness**: The user doesn't need to know *how* the balance is stored, only *how to get it*.\n\n### 🔍 How it Works (Name Mangling)\nPython doesn't actually make variables \"impossible\" to see. It uses **Name Mangling**. It renames `__balance` to `_BankAccount__balance`. This makes it hard to find by accident, but a determined programmer can still find it. Python trusts the programmer but gives them a warning: \"If it starts with `__`, don't touch it!\"\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Over-Privacy**: Making every single variable private, which makes the class annoying to use.\n- **Bypassing Mangling**: Trying to access mangled names directly instead of using the provided methods (getters/setters).\n\n### What to Remember\n- Use `__` for private data.\n- Use public methods to access or change private data safely.\n- Encapsulation is about **Information Hiding**.",

Because it doesn't have to keep calling `.append()` (which is a function lookup), list comprehensions are actually **faster** than regular for loops for creating lists!\n\n### Real-World Usage\n- Transforming data (e.g., converting a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit).\n- Filtering complex lists of objects (e.g., getting all users who are 'active').\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Over-nesting**: Trying to put three loops and four `if` statements into one line. If it's hard to read, use a regular loop!\n- **Missing the `[]`**: Forgetting that a list comprehension **always** needs square brackets.\n\n### What to Remember\n- Syntax: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`.\n- It replaces the need for an empty list and a `.append()` loop.\n- Readability is more important than being clever.",

It then searches for a matching `except` block. If it finds one, it jumps there. If not, it keeps going up (to the caller) until it either finds a handler or crashes the program.\n\n### Common Exceptions\n- `TypeError`: Wrong data type used.\n- `NameError`: Using a variable that hasn't been defined.\n- `KeyError`: Looking for a missing key in a dictionary.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Catching EVERYTHING**: Using `except:` (without a specific error name). This hides bugs and makes your program hard to fix.\n- **Empty except**: Catching an error and doing nothing. Always at least print a message!\n\n### What to Remember\n- Use `try` for risky code.\n- Be specific about which error you are catching.\n- `finally` always runs.",

If you put them in a list, your computer would run out of memory. **Generators** allow you to process data one-by-one **without** storing it all at once.\n\n### The yield Keyword\nA generator looks like a function, but it uses `yield` instead of `return`.\n\n```python\ndef count_to_three():\n    yield 1\n    yield 2\n    yield 3\n\ngen = count_to_three()\nprint(next(gen)) # 1\nprint(next(gen)) # 2\n```\n\n### Memory Efficiency\n- **List**: Stores everything in RAM. `[0, 1, 2 ... 1,000,000]`\n- **Generator**: remebers the current state and only calculates the **next** value when you ask for it.\n\n### 🔍 How it Works (The Pause Button)\nWhen Python hits `yield`, it **pauses** the function and sends the value back. It remembers the exact line, local variables, and execution state. When you call `next()`, it \"unpauses\" and continues exactly where it left off.\n\n### Real-Life Analogy: The Buffet vs. Made-to-Order\n- **List (Buffet)**: All the food is prepared and sitting on the table (taking up space).\n- **Generator (Made-to-Order)**: The chef only makes the next dish when you sit down and ask for it.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Trying to index a generator**: You cannot do `gen[0]`. You must use a loop or `next()`.\n- **Exhausting a generator**: Once a generator reaches the end, you cannot \"reset\" it. You must create a new one.\n\n### What to Remember\n- Generators use `yield`.\n- They save massive amounts of memory.\n- They are \"lazyly evaluated\" (only work when asked).",

                "content": "# 🎀 Decorators: wrapping Functions\n\n**Decorators** are one of the most powerful features of Python. They allow you to add new behavior to an existing function without changing its code. It is literally \"wrapping\" one function inside another.\n\n### Basic Example\n```python\ndef my_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper():\n        print(\"Something before.\")\n        func()\n        print(\"Something after.\")\n    return wrapper\n\n@my_decorator\ndef say_hi():\n    print(\"Hi!\")\n\nsay_hi()\n```\n\n### Why use Decorators?\n- **Logging**: Automatically record every time a function is called.\n- **Timing**: Measure how long a piece of code takes to run.\n- **Authentication**: Check if a user is logged in before allowing them to run a function.\n\n### 🔍 How it Works\nIn Python, **functions are objects**. You can pass a function into another function as an argument. The `@my_decorator` syntax is just a \"wrapper\" that replaces your original function with the new `wrapper` version that contains the extra logic.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Forgetting `return wrapper`**: If you don't return the new function, your decorated function will become `None`.\n- **Handling Arguments**: If your original function takes arguments, your `wrapper` must also take them (usually using `*args` and `**kwargs`).\n\n### What to Remember\n- Decorators use the `@` symbol.\n- They help in separating \"What the function does\" from \"How it is managed\".\n- They promote clean, modular code.",

Now let's understand why they are so important and how they work.\n\n### What is a Context Manager?\nIt's a system to manage resources (like files, database connections, or network sockets) that need to be opened and **guaranteed to close**, even if something fails.\n\n### Custom Context Manager\nYou can create your own using the `contextlib` module or by creating a class with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.\n\n```python\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager\n\n@contextmanager\ndef temp_setup():\n    print(\"Setting up resources...\")\n    yield\n    print(\"Cleaning up resources...\")\n\nwith temp_setup():\n    print(\"Doing work.\")\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works\n1. **__enter__**: Runs the setup code (like opening a file).\n2. **The Body**: Runs your code inside the `with` block.\n3. **__exit__**: Runs automatically at the end. crucially, it runs even if an error happened inside the `with` block!\n\n### Real-World Analogy: Borrowing a Library Book\n1. **__enter__**: You check out the book (Setup).\n2. **Body**: You read the book at home.\n3. **__exit__**: You return the book (Cleanup). Even if you spilled coffee on it or lost your bookmark, you **must** return it to the library so others can use it.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Forgetting `yield` in decorators**: Without `yield`, the code inside the `with` block will never run.\n- **Manual closing**: Trying to manually close a file inside a `with` block. It's redundant and can lead to errors.\n\n### What to Remember\n- Use `with` to handle resource cleanup.\n- Context managers prevent \"Memory Leaks\" and locked files.\n- They make your code safer and more professional.",

For example, your Python script can ask Google for the weather or ask Twitter for the latest tweets.\n\n### The 'requests' Library\nPython's `requests` library is the industry standard for making HTTP requests (interacting with the web).\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://api.github.com/users/google\")\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    data = response.json()\n    print(f\"Company Name: {data['name']}\")\n```\n\n### HTTP Methods\n- **GET**: Asking for data from a server.\n- **POST**: Sending data the server (like logging in).\n\n### 🔍 How it Works\n1. **The Request**: Your computer sends a \"packet\" of data to the server's URL.\n2. **The Processing**: The server looks at its database and finds what you asked for.\n3. **The Response**: The server sends back a status code (like `200` for OK) and the data (usually in **JSON** format).\n\n### Real-Life Analogy: The Restaurant Menu\n- **You**: The Client (Petitioner).\n- **The Menu**: The API (shows you what you can ask for).\n- **The Waiter**: The Request/Response cycle (takes your order and brings back the food).\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Ignoring Status Codes**: Assuming every request works. Always check if `status_code == 200`!\n- **Hardcoding Keys**: Putting your secret API keys directly in the code. Professionals use environment variables.\n\n### What to Remember\n- Use `requests.get()` to fetch data.\n- `.json()` converts web text into a Python Dictionary.\n- 200 means success; 404 means not found.",

                "content": "# 📊 Introduction to Data Science\n\nPython is the #1 language for data science because of two libraries: **NumPy** and **Pandas**. They allow you to handle millions of rows of data as easily as a small list.\n\n### NumPy (Numerical Python)\nUsed for complex math and massive arrays. It is much faster than regular Python lists.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\narr = np.array([1, 2, 3])\nprint(arr * 2) # [2, 4, 6] - Fast vector math!\n```\n\n### Pandas (Data Analysis)\nThink of Pandas as \"Excel for Python\". It uses **DataFrames** (tables) to organize information.\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ndata = {\"Name\": [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"], \"Score\": [90, 80]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\nprint(df.mean()) # Automatically calculates averages\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works\nThese libraries are written in **C** and **Fortran**. When you run `df.mean()`, Python isn't doing the math; it's sending the data to highly optimized C code that can process millions of rows in milliseconds. This is known as **Vectorization**.\n\n### Why Learn This?\nData Science is used for predicting stock markets, finding diseases in medical scans, and even recommending movies on Netflix.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Looping through DataFrames**: Using a `for` loop to process a Pandas table is very slow. Use built-in functions like `.apply()` or vectorized math instead.\n- **Confusing Series and DataFrames**: A DataFrame is a whole table; a Series is just one column.\n\n### What to Remember\n- NumPy = Math and Arrays.\n- Pandas = Tables and Data Analysis.\n- They are the foundation of AI and Big Data.",

                "content": "# 🕷️ Simple Web Scraping\n\n**Web Scraping** is the process of using a script to automatically extract information from a website. Instead of copy-pasting, Python does it for you!\n\n### Tools: BeautifulSoup\nWe use `BeautifulSoup` to parse (search through) the HTML code of a webpage.\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport requests\n\n# 1. Get the page\nhtml = requests.get(\"http://example.com\").text\n# 2. Parse the HTML\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html, \"html.parser\")\n# 3. Extract the title\nprint(soup.title.string)\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works\n1. **HTTP Request**: Python gets the raw HTML code of the site (which looks like a mess of tags).\n2. **The Parser**: BeautifulSoup builds a \"Tree\" of these tags (h1, p, div).\n3. **Searching**: You can ask for \"the first h1 tag\" or \"all links that start with https\".\n\n### Ethics of Scraping\n- **Be Polite**: Don't scrape too fast, or you might crash the website (or get banned).\n- **robots.txt**: Always check `website.com/robots.txt` to see if they allow scraping.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Scraping Dynamic Sites**: Some sites (like Facebook or Twitter) use JavaScript to load data. BeautifulSoup cannot \"see\" this data; you would need a tool like **Selenium**.\n- **Not handling errors**: If the website changes its design, your scraper will break. Use `try...except`!\n\n### What to Remember\n- Web scraping converts messy websites into clean data.\n- Needs `requests` and `bs4` (BeautifulSoup).\n- Always check if scraping is allowed.",

In this lesson, we will combine everything we've learned to build a bot that checks a price and sends an alert.\n\n### The Workflow of a Bot\n1. **Trigger**: When should the bot run? (e.g., every 24 hours).\n2. **Action**: What should it do? (e.g., scrape a product price).\n3. **Decision**: Is the price < $100? (If/Else).\n4. **Notification**: Send a message or print an alert.\n\n### Basic Bot Structure\n```python\nimport time\nimport random\n\ndef check_price():\n    # Simulate scraping a price\n    return random.randint(80, 120)\n\nwhile True:\n    price = check_price()\n    print(f\"Current Price: ${price}\")\n    if price < 90:\n        print(\"HOT DEAL! Buy now.\")\n        break # Stop after finding the deal\n    time.sleep(10) # Wait 10 seconds before checking again\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works\n- **The Loop**: Keeps the bot alive.\n- **time.sleep()**: This is crucial! It tells the bot to \"sleep\" so it doesn't overload the CPU or the website server.\n- **Variables**: Store historical data so the bot can see if a price is going up or down.\n\n### Real-World Use Cases\n- **Trading Bots**: Automatically buy/sell stocks.\n- **Ticket Bots**: Notify you when concert tickets are available.\n- **News Bots**: Scrape Twitter for specific keywords.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **No Sleep**: Running a loop without `time.sleep()` will make your computer fans spin at max speed!\n- **Hardcoding everything**: Use variables so you can change the target price or URL easily.\n\n### What to Remember\n- Bots are just loops with logic inside.\n- Use `time.sleep()` to be a \"good citizen\" of the internet.\n- Always have a way to stop the bot (like a `break` or a key press).",

                "content": "# 🧠 Interview Prep: Conceptual\n\nTo land a job as a Python developer, you need to understand not just *how* to write code, but *how Python works* under the hood. Here are the most common conceptual questions asked in interviews.\n\n### 1. How is memory managed in Python?\nPython uses **Automatic Memory Management**. It has a **Garbage Collector** that uses \"Reference Counting\". When an object's reference count drops to zero (meaning no variable points to it anymore), Python automatically deletes it from memory.\n\n### 2. Interpreted vs. Compiled?\nPython is often called an interpreted language, but it's actually both. It first compiles your code into **Bytecode** (.pyc files), and then the **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)** interprets that bytecode into machine instructions.\n\n### 3. What is the GIL?\nThe **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** is a mutex that allows only one thread to hold control of the Python interpreter at a time. This means even if you have an 8-core CPU, standard Python can only run one thread of code at a time. (Note: This is why we use Multiprocessing for heavy tasks!)\n\n### Real-World Advice: The 'Star' Method\nWhen answering interview questions, use the **STAR** method: **S**ituation, **T**ask, **A**ction, **R**esult. Don't just say \"I know OOP\"; explain a project where you used inheritance to save time.\n\n### What to Remember\n- Python uses Garbage Collection for memory.\n- The GIL limits multi-threading.\n- Bytecode is the middle-step between your code and the computer.",

The goal isn't just the right answer—it's showing your **Problem Solving Process**.\n\n### Common Patterns\n1. **Two Pointers**: Used for searching pairs in a sorted list.\n2. **Frequency Counters**: Using Dictionaries to count occurrences of characters or numbers.\n3. **Recursion**: Solving a problem by breaking it into smaller versions of itself.\n\n### Practice Problem: Two Sum\n*Task: Find if two numbers in a list add up to a target.*\n```python\ndef two_sum(nums, target):\n    seen = {} # Frequency Counter pattern\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        diff = target - num\n        if diff in seen:\n            return [seen[diff], i]\n        seen[num] = i\n    return []\n```\n\n### 🔍 How it Works\nInstead of checking every pair (which would take $O(n^2)$ time), we use a **Dictionary** to store what we've already seen. This makes the search much faster ($O(n)$ time) because looking up a key in a dictionary is instant.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Coding before thinking**: Jumping into the code without explaining your plan to the interviewer.\n- **Ignoring Edge Cases**: What if the list is empty? What if there are no matching numbers?\n\n### What to Remember\n- Always explain your logic out loud.\n- Time Complexity ($O(n)$) matters as much as the solution.\n- Practice with Dictionaries; they are the most common tool in coding interviews.",

Don't use Tabs.\n- **Naming**: \n  - Functions/Variables: `snake_case`\n  - Classes: `PascalCase`\n  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`\n- **Line Length**: Try to keep lines under 79 characters.\n- **Imports**: Put all imports at the very top of the file, grouped by type.\n\n### The 'Zen of Python'\nIf you type `import this` in any Python terminal, you will see the philosophy of Python. \n- \"Simple is better than complex.\"\n- \"Readability counts.\"\n- \"Explicit is better than implicit.\"\n\n### 🔍 Why it Works\nBy following a standard, any Python developer can look at your code and understand it immediately. This reduces \"Technical Debt\" and makes it easier for teams to build large applications together.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- **Meaningless Names**: Using `x` or `data` instead of `user_email` or `price_list`.\n- **Long Functions**: Writing 100 lines of code in one function. Break it down into 3-4 smaller functions!\n\n### What to Remember\n- Use 4 spaces for indentation.\n- Follow `snake_case` naming.\n- Readability is the highest priority.",
