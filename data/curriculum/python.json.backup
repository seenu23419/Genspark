Write logic, not byte-manipulation.\n- Interpreted: Run scripts directly with 'python script.py'. No separate compilation step.\n- Dynamically Typed: Variables hold objects. Types checked at runtime, not compile-time.\n- Large Ecosystem: Standard library + millions of packages (requests, pandas, fastapi, numpy).\n- Readable Syntax: Clean, English-like code. Less boilerplate than C, Java, or C++.\n\nExample of Python simplicity:\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n\nWhy Learn Python?\n1. Fast to write: Ideas in fewer lines than Java.\n2. Easy to read: Even unfamiliar code is quickly understandable.\n3. Huge community: Billions of lines written, thousands of tutorials, active forums.\n4. Versatile: Web backends, data science, ML, automation, scientific computing, games.\n5. Beginner-friendly: No memory pointers, no manual garbage collection.\n6. Industry adoption: Google, Netflix, Instagram, Spotify, Microsoft use Python.\n\nCommon Use Cases:\n- Web API Backend: FastAPI, Django for REST APIs.\n- Data Analysis: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.\n- Machine Learning: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.\n- Automation: Scripts for DevOps, testing, task scheduling.\n- Scientific Computing: NumPy, SciPy simulations.\n- Teaching: Ideal for learning programming fundamentals.\n\nPython Philosophy:\nRun 'import this' in Python to see 20 guiding principles:\n- \"Beautiful is better than ugly\"\n- \"Explicit is better than implicit\"\n- \"Simple is better than complex\"\n- \"Readability counts\"\n\nSummary:\nPython is a high-level, readable language with a huge ecosystem. Excels at rapid development, data work, and teaching.",

On Windows:\n   - Run the installer.\n   - CRITICAL: Check the box \"Add Python to PATH\".\n   - Click \"Install Now\".\n   - Verify: Open PowerShell and type: python --version\n3. On macOS/Linux:\n   - macOS: Use brew install python3\n   - Linux: sudo apt-get install python3 (Ubuntu/Debian)\n\n**Step 2: REPL vs Scripts**\n\nREPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):\n- Type 'python' in terminal to enter interactive mode.\n- Useful for quick experiments: >>> 2 + 2 \u2192 4\n- Each line executes immediately; no file needed.\n- Press Ctrl+D to exit.\n\nScripts:\n- Save code in a .py file (e.g., hello.py).\n- Run with: python hello.py\n- Best for organized, reusable programs.\n\n**Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment (venv)**\n\nWhy venv? Different projects need different package versions. venv isolates dependencies so Project A and Project B don't conflict.\n\nCreate venv (Windows PowerShell):\npython -m venv venv\n\nCreate venv (macOS/Linux):\npython3 -m venv venv\n\nThis creates a folder 'venv' with an isolated Python interpreter.\n\nActivate venv (Windows PowerShell):\n.\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate\n\nActivate venv (macOS/Linux):\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\nAfter activation, terminal prompt changes (e.g., (venv) C:\\Users\\...>). This indicates venv is active.\n\nDeactivate (if needed):\ndeactivate\n\n**Step 4: Install Packages with pip**\n\npip is Python's package manager. It installs packages into the active venv.\n\nInstall a package:\npip install requests\n\nThis fetches 'requests' library from PyPI and installs it into your venv.\n\nCheck installed packages:\npip list\n\nSave dependencies to a file (for sharing projects):\npip freeze > requirements.txt\n\nInstall dependencies from a file:\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n**Step 5: Run Your First Script**\n\n1. Create a file hello.py:\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n\n2. Run it:\npython hello.py\n\nOutput: Hello, world!\n\n**Complete Workflow:**\n\nmkdir my_project\ncd my_project\npython -m venv venv\n.\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate (Windows)\npip install requests\npython hello.py\ndeactivate\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\nAlways create and activate a venv before working on Python projects. This keeps dependencies isolated and reproducible.",
